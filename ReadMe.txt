- 'ProcessingLines' contains the full pre- and post-processing pipeline;
- it calls functions and scripts contained into 'called';
- in 'called', subfolders organize scripts/functions for ERP, TFR, Beat, and phase analyses. 

Note that you'll need to FieldTrip toolbox to run some of the analyses.
